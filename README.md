## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript 


### What I learned

*Flexbox skills* 

The entire project helps me review the ability acquires with **flexbox**, we review the property `row-reverse` of **flex-direction** achieving the layout of the master page where the organisation is straightly organised in **one dimension** 

*animation*

I also introduce some animations throughout all the links, and title within our project. By using the property `letter-spacing`, this give a better dynamic and fun effect to the run

*adaptation*

i come to the fact that the only logo svg gave couldn't meet with the required background of the last section of our project. We find some path and modificate a bit our html ( section **furtherwith_easy** ) to help the logo melt without disappearing with the **--dark-blue** background affection of this section board.
Hence, we increased a little bit code to the Desktop responsivenness media query 

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development

All along  the project we see about **open API** and **fast onboarding** some area calling to **manage data**. We talk about `banking`, we need to step the frame of keeping data in secure variable and affects them really when it imply the necessity. Some dedicated time in future we need to tackle how to  manage and store data more effectively.
